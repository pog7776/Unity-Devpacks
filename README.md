## Usage

Unity seems to be a bit uncooperative with Github packages.

I'm working on setting up a proper package registry.

### Example `manifest.json`

#### Github packages

```
{
    "dependencies": {
        "com.tricklecharge.unity.art.devart": "https://github.com/pog7776/Unity-Devpacks.git?path=/Packages/com.tricklecharge.unity.art.devart",
        "com.tricklecharge.unity.attributes": "https://github.com/pog7776/Unity-Devpacks.git?path=/Packages/com.tricklecharge.unity.attributes",
        "com.tricklecharge.unity.drone": "https://github.com/pog7776/Unity-Devpacks.git?path=/Packages/com.tricklecharge.unity.drone",
        "com.tricklecharge.unity.math": "https://github.com/pog7776/Unity-Devpacks.git?path=/Packages/com.tricklecharge.unity.math",
        "com.tricklecharge.unity.physics": "https://github.com/pog7776/Unity-Devpacks.git?path=/Packages/com.tricklecharge.unity.physics",
        "com.tricklecharge.unity.vehicles": "https://github.com/pog7776/Unity-Devpacks.git?path=/Packages/com.tricklecharge.unity.vehicles"
    }
}
```

#### Scoped Registry Example

```
"scopedRegistries": [
    {
        "name": "Github Packages",
        "url": "https://npm.pkg.github.com/@pog7776/",
        "scopes": [
            "com.tricklecharge.unity.packages.devpacks"
        ]
    }
]
```

> **Note**

> `scopedRegistries` doesn't really seem to work for github.
